# EGSH
This is my little shell program, the Egg-Shell (after my initials, **E**lliot **G**rant **Sh**abram)

I've added functionality to print the working directory, cd, run any linux command, read in files, and fully functioning redirects. Soon I will add piping and hopefully some color to the files and folders so that we can tell them apart.

I plan to use this shell for implementing my own CLI for future projects.
